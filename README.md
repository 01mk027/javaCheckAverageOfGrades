## Introduction and purpose of code
This small software is developed for Java101 course on <a href="https://patika.dev">patika.dev</a>. This software is developed to determine average of 5 lectures which are listed below.

+ Math
+ Physics
+ Turkish
+ Chemistry
+ Music

If grade of one or more of relevant lectures is/are entered out of 0 and 100, relevant lecture is not added to sum, so not accepted as valid grade. On calculating average, relevant lecture/lectures is underestimated.

Thanks!
